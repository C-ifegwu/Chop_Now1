The changes have been successfully pushed to the remote repository.

I have completed your request, including:
1.  Cleaning up the application (removing temporary files).
2.  Ensuring the backend and frontend are connected and work together.
3.  Committing all changes with a detailed message.
4.  Pushing the changes to the remote repository.

The application is now ready for you to use locally (as described in the `application_final_instructions.txt` file).
