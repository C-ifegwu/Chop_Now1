[ChopNow: Africa's Food Rescue and Affordable Meals Platform ]




Description of the concept of their Mission;
My mission is to reduce food waste and improve access to affordable meals across Africa by building a digital platform that connects local food vendors, restaurants, and consumers. The platform, ChopNow, allows food vendors to sell surplus meals at discounted prices to customers who need them, creating a win-win solution: vendors reduce losses, while consumers access affordable, quality food.
This mission is relevant in Africa because food waste and hunger coexist as major societal challenges. Despite Africa producing enough food to feed its population, millions of people still go hungry due to inefficiencies in distribution and access. ChopNow addresses this issue by leveraging digital technology and mobile platforms, which are already widely used in Africa, to ensure that surplus food finds its way to families who need it.

Problem statement:
Food insecurity is one of Africa's most pressing challenges. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), nearly 37% of food produced in Sub-Saharan Africa is lost or wasted before it reaches consumers. At the same time, more than 282 million Africans experience hunger (World Food Program, 2023).
Who: Low-income families, students, and local vendors are most affected. Vendors lose revenue when food is unsold, while families cannot afford regular meals.

What: The dual problem is food waste and lack of affordable access.

When: This issue occurs daily, especially in urban areas with high food production and consumption cycles.

Where: The problem is widespread across Africa, particularly in cities like Kigali, Lagos, Nairobi, and Johannesburg, where food supply chains are active but unevenly distributed.

Why: Lack of affordable digital infrastructure to connect surplus food supply with demand. Vendors have no platform to sell excess food quickly, and consumers are unaware of where to find affordable options.

How: By creating an accessible mobile-first application that matches vendors with surplus food to nearby consumers in real time, ChopNow solves both sides of the problem.
Unlike existing food delivery apps, ChopNow focuses on affordability and food rescue, not just convenience. Its unique proposition is sustainability + social impact, making it different from traditional delivery platforms.



Software development model
For ChopNow, I will use the Agile Software Development Model.
This model is most relevant because ChopNow requires constant testing, feedback, and iteration with both vendors and consumers. Since food waste and affordability are dynamic problems, the platform needs flexibility to adapt quickly.
Steps I will use in Agile for ChopNow:
Requirement Gathering: Conduct surveys and interviews with vendors and families.


Planning: Define sprint goals (e.g., vendor onboarding, order flow, and payment).


Development: Build features in small increments (ordering, notifications, discounts).


Testing: Gather feedback from vendors and pilot users.


Deployment: Launch an MVP in a small community or campus.


Iteration: Improve the system based on user behavior and feedback.

The hypothesis of their solution
If ChopNow is deployed, food waste in pilot communities will reduce by at least 20% within the first year, while enabling thousands of families to access affordable meals. Vendors will save money by selling food that would otherwise go to waste, and consumers will benefit from discounted prices.
This solution will not only improve affordability but also contribute to sustainability, reduce carbon emissions from waste, and improve community health.
